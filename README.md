# Simulation-Study-Simple-Linear-Regression
Generate data with X∼N(μ=2,σ=0.1), sample size n=100, and error term ϵ∼N(μ=0,σ=0.5)
Simple linear regression fitted to the simulated data.Estimated prediction equation and estimated coefficients and their standard errors analyzed for significance. 
Observed t-statistic(s), p-value(s), and interpret the estimates and test results along with MSE.
Resimulate and examine different MSE levels for  ϵ∼N(0,σ=1) and/or n-400.
